Its job - like almost every other big-ticket defence project of the 1950s - was to deliver nuclear incineration to the Soviets, their neighbours, and anyone else who might get in the way. The way it did this was stark,  brute-fore engineering. No stealth for the XB70. Instead, a high-altitude dash, straight to its target at over Mach 3. At 70,000 feet (twice the altitude of a modern passenger jet) it would leave Soviet interceptors in its wake, scrambling to catch up. 

Or, that was the plan, at least. It the mid-50s, winning a drag race against fighter jets seems sensible. But within a few years, improved surface-to-air missiles made this assumption questionable. Any question as to the efficacy of Soviet missiles ended on May Day, 1960,  when the slow, but high-flying U2 spy plane was shot down over the USSR by a SA-75 missile. Like Gary Power's U2, the idea of a outrunning missiles ended up in a smoking pile of wreckage.

So if fast and high was out, what would the alternative be? The answer was to fly low, and relatively slow. Exactly the kind of thing the XB-70 was not designed to do. This is now a problem. What to do with a straight-line, high-altitude speed machine, when the only forseeable way to get through the enemies defences was to slip underneath them?
